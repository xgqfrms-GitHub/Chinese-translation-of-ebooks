Web Storage 
网络存储

When the World Wide Web was first envisioned, it was intended as a repository for static documents, primarily academic papers.

The key distinguishing feature of the World Wide Web was hyperlinks, which allowed one document to provide a link to another document, and therefore allowed convenient navigation from one piece of information to another.

It wasn’t long before web pages started providing more advanced features, such as online shopping. This required web pages to dynamically respond to user interaction. 

As you have seen, this was facilitated by technologies such as the DOM API, which allows a web page to be modifi ed after it was loaded.


HTML and JavaScript could only take you so far, however. It still was not possible to create
web pages or web applications that exhibited the features typically found in native desktop
applications. For instance, web pages lacked the following capabilities:

➤
The ability to interact with the fi le system beyond the simple  file input type.

➤
The ability to store large amounts of data or confi guration information inside the
browser (on the client).

➤
The ability to function without a network connection. Even if a page is cached inside a
browser, it typically is not usable without a network connection.

➤
The ability to perform intensive processing on a background thread without impacting
the user experience. Because all JavaScript processing occurs on a single thread, any
intensive processing will cause the web page to “lock up.”

➤
The ability to request additional data from a server after a page had loaded without
performing a refresh of the entire web page.

You can think of these features as the services accessible to a software application. For a
traditional desktop application, the operating system provides these services. Web pages
cannot interact directly with the operating system; they can only interact with the browser.
Therefore, unless the browser provided these services, web pages would always be constrained
from achieving a higher level of sophistication.
