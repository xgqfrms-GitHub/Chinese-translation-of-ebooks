#  Introduction to HTML5
> This lesson is an introduction to the HTML5 markup language. The HTML5 markup
language is a language for structuring and expressing the content of a web page in a manner
that can be consistently interpreted by a web browser.
If you are already familiar with HTML, much of this lesson will look very familiar. It is
still important that you read through this lesson, however, because there are a number of
important changes in HTML5, and many of these are very subtle.
If you are not familiar with HTML, or have only a passing familiarity, this lesson will provide
you with the background you need to understand the basics of an HTML web page. This
lesson is only an introduction, however; the material in this lesson will be enhanced in the
remainder of this section.
